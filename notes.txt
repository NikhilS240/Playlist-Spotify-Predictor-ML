Challenge ideas:

make a front end client for my data
Not use spotipy
make graphs to show trends over time





1 collect data from the spotify API
make a python dataframe with all of the stuff  (while cleaning preparing)
machine learning alg usage (random forest), or make my own Hamming, Jaccard, Euclidean
evaluate the model




need to also make a package so people can download the dependeices like pytorch







#to test, I make a playlist and compare using KNN what spotify gets and me in the songs

#i can use mean pooling for when there is two artists within a song
